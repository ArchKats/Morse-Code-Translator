# Morse-Code-Translator
This is a stupid and meaningless morse code translator 
Is it stupid? Yes.
But does it work? Also Yes.

Also you probably need to have gcc and ncurse installed.

Installation
1. Make Install.sh executable using chmod +x Install.sh
2. Execute it
3. Yay!! (except if it doesn't work the not yay)
